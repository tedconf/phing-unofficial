  Upgrading to 2.4.0
  ------------------

  This release of Phing contains numerous significant enhancements over
  previous versions, such as new tasks (SSH, SCP, JsMin, SVN and more),
  documentation fixes and various bug fixes.
  
  There were also some changes that might break backwards compatibility,
  or change the behavior of Phing in such a way that requires changes
  to your build file(s).
  
  Backwards compatibility
  -----------------------
  
  Note that this release of Phing drops PHPUnit2 compatibility, and
  requires PHPUnit3 (www.phpunit.de) to run tests.
  
  Additionally, the way Phing treats symbolic links was changed. Phing
  now considers symbolic links to be files, regardless of whether they
  point to an existing file or directory.
  Consequently, directory operations on symbolic links will fail.
  
  By default, Phing no longer automatically de-references symbolic links.
  In other words, the CopyTask will now copy symbolic links "as is", not
  duplicate the contents as with previous versions of Phing.
  
  To emulate the old behavior, the <fileset> element now accepts the
  boolean argument 'expandsymboliclinks'.
  
  PEAR package
  ------------
  
  This release splits the PEAR package in two packages, the existing
  'phing' and the new (and optional) 'phingdocs'. The latter package
  is listed as an optional dependency in the 'phing' package, and allows
  installation on deployment/production machines without the additional
  footprint of the documentation.

  More information
